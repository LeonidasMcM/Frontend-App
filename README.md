Final project:
Ikagura themed game, top down spaceship shooter where the objectiver is to make it through waves of enemies
At the current time the game is intialized with sounds,graphics, and working mechanics
- We want to add better functionality to button presses and other adjustments to make the program smooth and more graphically enhanced
- so far it looks pretty good :)

Update!
after doing more research it has come to my attention that a smoothing of the controls is not possible the way the game has been developed thusfar.
this is disappointing but a nessecary hurdle in new development.
I may try to remake this game in unity to help streamline it somewhat.
- this version is unworking but serves as a great lesson
